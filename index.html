		<p>just like perfume when you smell it</p>
		<p>it reminds you of the person who use it alot</p>
		<p>it goes same with problem if any place,song,person or anything that reminds you of your problem or
		bad memories</p>
		<p>stay away from it even if your heart love it but you know it will hurt</p>
	    <p>shut down that heart of yours and listen to your brain so you can have better future for yourself</p>

		<p style="margin: 0 0 -25px 8px;">3.FIND PEOPLE WHO CAN HELP YOU GET BETTER</p><br>

		<p>as we know this world is full of fake people and the only thing they want is to use you for their own happiness</p>
		<p>but there are also a lot of people who is kind,wise and want good for their family and people around them</p>

		<p style="margin: 10px 0 -25px 8px;">4.EXERSICE</p><br>
		<img src="https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/getting-back-to-exercise-routine.jpg" width="190" height="175">
		<p>you may laugh or ask yourself how exercise will help me</p>
		<p>but believe me when you exercise and your body and mindset get better</p>
		<p>your life get more better and you will feel happy</p>
	    <p>and start thanking yourself so go find a exercise</p>

	<section class="sec5">
		<p style="margin: 10px 0 -25px 8px;">5.READ BOOKS</p><br>
		<img src="https://basmo.app/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/reading-multiple-books-at-once.jpg" width="190" height="165">
		<p>i wanted to mention to go find a hobby but i thought instead of that i should tell you to read books</p>
		<p>because the power a book hold is far greater than anything</p>
		<p>when you train your mindset by reading books, your view and the way of thinking change</p>
		<p>and you will see things in possitive way</p>
	</section>
    <br>
	<p class="texttype">MUST READ.<p>
	<footer>
		<p>the last thing i want to mention is never lose hope and always think better for yourself and others
		make your happiness depend on other people happeniss </p>
		<p>never think of yourself highly like i am better than this or that</p>
		<p>those kind of people are people who dont care about other peolpe so dont forget the reason why you
		are changing yourself</p>
		LOVE FROM PARWEZ.
